5. Data types
   Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
   Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Strings, Interfaces, and Arrays.
   
 
6.what is  Class, Object and Method?
  class has -Modifiers,Class name,Superclass(if any),Interfaces(if any),Body
  Method has- Modifiers,static or nothing, return type,arguments and Body
  Object has- state/properties and Behaviour
  
7.Naming Convention in Java.
  • Class name Should always start with Uppercase.
  • Method should start with lower case.
  • Package name should always be lowercase.
  • Constant should be in uppercase.
 
 Rules for Naming od Variable:
 All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_).

• After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.

 • A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.

 • Most importantly, identifiers are case sensitive.

 • Examples of legal identifiers: age, $salary, _value, __1_value.

 • Examples of illegal identifiers: 123abc, -salary.
   
8.Types of Veriables (static keyword)
  local veriables
  instance veriables
  static veriables
  
 9. Operators in Java
     
	 Arithmatic operator
	   +,-,*,/,%
	 
	 Relational operator
	   <,>,<=,>=,==,!=
	 
	 Unary operator
	   exp++,exp--,++exp,--exp,~,!
	   
	 Bitwise Operators
	   &,^,|
	   
	 Logical operators
	   && , ||
	   
	 Assignment Operators
	   = ,+= ,-= ,*= ,/= ,%= 
	   
	 Ternery Operators (if-then-else)
	  ? :
	 
10. Decision Making/Control statements in Java
	 
	 If statements- 
	  if, if-else, if-else-ladder, nested-if
	  
	 method with parameter
	 
	 Switch statement- switch fall through, switch, nested switch
	 
	 Arrays in Java---int a[] = new int[5];
	 
	 for loops- for loop, nested for loop, Labeled for loop ,for each loop

	 while loops- while, do-while
	 
	 java break and continue
	 
10.2 Scope of veriable
	 
11. return types in java

11.2 Scanner in java
	 
12. Constructors in java- default constructor, parameterized constructor  
     How constructors are different from methods in Java?
     • Constructor(s) must have the same name as the class within which it defined while it is not necessary for the method in java.
     • Constructor(s) do not return any type while method(s) have the return type or void if does not return any value.
     • Constructor is called only once at the time of Object creation while method(s) can be called any numbers of time

13. "this" key word in java
     Usage of java this keyword
     1. this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
     2. this can be used to invoke current class method 
     3. this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.
     4. this can be passed as an argument in the method call.
	 5. this can be used as return type in method

OOPS (Inheritance,Polymorphism,Abstraction and Encapsulation)

14. Inheritance in Java

Polymorphism

15. Method overloading in java-- compile time polymorphism

16. method Overriding in java-- run time polymorphism

17. super keywork in java

18. Interface-cannot instantiate	

19. Abstract class-cannot instantiate, contructor
